First, I started by going ahead and adding a more specific title, and naming it "Horiseon" since that is the website's name and the main page of the site. By doing this, it allows the title to be shown in the browser bar/tab so that visitors know exactly where they are in the site. 

Then I went through the source code and making sure there were semantic elements, so that meant getting rid of any unnecessary divs and replacing them with more readable elements. Since div doesn't really tell the user about the contents, I instead used elements like header, footer, nav, artivle, etc, therefore making the site more accessible. 

I also went through and made sure all the image elements had "alt" attributes. By doing this, the images have more description, making them more accessible for visually impaired visitors. 

Then I made sure that all the heading attributes fell in sequential order. For exaple : h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 instead of something like h2, h4, h1, h3. This allows the code to be more readable instead of being confusing and out of order. 

Lastly, I made sure all of the elements follow a logical structure on a separate style.css file instead of adding the styles to the html.file, making the code easier to read and less busy.
